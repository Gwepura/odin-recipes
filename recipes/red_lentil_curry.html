    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a rich and hearty lentil curry, great as a main meal rather than as a side dish 
      like the more traditional Indian dhal. Don't let the ingredient list faze you, this really 
      is an easy dish to make. This dish is great served with basmati rice.</p>
      
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups red lentils</li>
      <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons curry paste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger</li>
      <li>1 (14.25 ounce) can tomato puree</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Wash the lentils in cold water until the water runs clear. Put lentils in a pot with 
        enough water to cover; bring to a boil, place a cover on the pot, reduce heat to medium-low, 
        and simmer, adding water during cooking as needed to keep covered, until tender, 
        15 to 20 minutes. Drain.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions in hot oil 
        until caramelized, about 20 minutes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Mix curry paste, curry powder, turmeric, cumin, chili powder, salt, sugar, garlic, 
        and ginger together in a large bowl; stir into the onions. Increase heat to high and cook, 
        stirring constantly, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Stir in the tomato puree, remove from heat and stir into the lentils.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
